This C++ project is developed for the Introduction to Programming course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, Sofia University. It implements a polynomial calculator capable of handling polynomials with rational coefficients, supporting the following functionalities:

1. Addition of two polynomials P(x) + Q(x)
2. Subtraction of two polynomials P(x) - Q(x)
3. Multiplication of two polynomials P(x) * Q(x)
4. Division of two polynomials P(x) / Q(x), where Q(x) ≠ 0 and deg(P(x)) ≥ deg(Q(x)). The program also calculates the quotient and remainder of the division.
5. Multiplication of a polynomial by a rational number
6. Evaluation of a polynomial for a given rational number
7. Calculation of the GCD (greatest common divisor) of two polynomials using the Euclidean algorithm
8. Vieta's formulas for polynomials
9. Representation of a polynomial in terms of powers of (x + a)
10. Factorization of polynomials (if factorable) and extraction of all rational roots

The project allows users to input polynomials with rational coefficients and perform arithmetic operations on them, along with additional functionalities such as finding roots, evaluating polynomials, and applying Vieta's formulas.
